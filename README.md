  ## Description 
I've created this portfolio page to complete the week 13 challenge of the edX front-end development bootcamp. In this module we focused on developing React skills, and this is the primary technology used when developing this portfolio page. 

 Developing this page helped me practice the following areas of front-end development:

  - Using react to build responsive websites
  - Using node.js commands.
  - Writing JavaScript functions and using built in functionalities such as .map.
  - Using react's router module.
  - Deploying react apps to GitHub pages.
  - GitHub workflow.
